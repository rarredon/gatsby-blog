description: The case to be made for Tech Lag
---
I listened to an interesting podcast which argued that tech debt is a
bit of a misnomer, and that perhaps a better analogy to describe tech
debt is jet lag. I agree with this perspective. Allowing excessive
tech debt sets a bad standard for quality and can cause fatigue around
understanding. Removing tech debt can often come with unknown
complexity, with uncertain estimates about "paying it back". In those
regards it is very similar to jet lag which can cause sluggishness for
an uncertain amount of time. Check out that podcast
